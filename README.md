Peer Review 1:
Looks Good, there are some differences between the html and figma, the favorite button on the top right doesnt do anything[client did not have a function for this-JD], i like how you adjusted the 7 day forecast too 5 days for the project, also it just needs to be overall bigger just sized up a little more to fit the whole page like the figma.

Peer Review #2 (Brandon Estrada) - Your weather app is functional, along with the JavaScript local storage. I liked the nice touch you gave for the home button that takes you back to your device's location. The hourly forecast is a nice touch. I also saw you were able to get the state code from saerching the city, this was something I struggle with and could not figure out. Great Job overall on the weather app!
