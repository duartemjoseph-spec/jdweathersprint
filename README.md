Peer Review 1:
Looks Good, there are some differences between the html and figma, the favorite button on the top right doesnt do anything[client did not have a function for this-JD], i like how you adjusted the 7 day forecast too 5 days for the project, also it just needs to be overall bigger just sized up a little more to fit the whole page like the figma.
